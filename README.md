# To-Do List App
This is a simple to-do list application built using React.js. 

The application leverages the following concepts:
### React useState Hook: Used to manage state within functional components.
### Spread Operator: Employed to dynamically update the to-do list array by creating a new array with the existing items plus the new item.
### Map Function: Utilized to render list items dynamically, iterating over the array of tasks and creating a list item for each task.

## Technologies Used:
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
